<p>
I am pursuing a PhD in Computer Science at the <a href="https://www.ubc.ca">University of British Columbia</a>,
where I am supervised by <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~fwood/">Frank Wood</a>. My research areas are probabilistic
programming, machine learning, and their application in real-world problems. I
am specifically interested in Bayesian inference and (conditional) generative
modeling and how these two frameworks may be combined by leveraging
probabilistic programming.

In 2018, I graduated with an MSc. in Mathematical Modelling and Computation
focusing on machine learning and signal processing at the <a href="https://www.dtu.dk/english">Technical University
of Denmark</a> (DTU), where I did research on feature extraction and Bayesian
non-parametrics, which was supervised by <a href="http://www.mortenmorup.dk/">Morten M&oslash;rup</a>. In 2016 I
received my BSc. in Earth and Space Physics and Engineering at DTU, where i
researched acoustofluidics, specifically acoustic levitation of particles, which
was supervised by <a href="https://www.staff.dtu.dk/bruus">Henrik Bruus</a>.
