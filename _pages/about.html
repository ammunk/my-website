<p>
I am pursuing a PhD in Computer Science at the <a href="https://www.ubc.ca">University of British Columbia</a>,
supervised by <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~fwood/">Frank Wood</a>. My research areas are probabilistic programming,
machine learning, and their application in real-world problems. I am
specifically interested in Bayesian inference and (conditional) generative
modeling using deep learning and how these two frameworks may be combined by
leveraging probabilistic programming.

In 2018, I graduated with an MSc. in Mathematical Modelling and Computation
focusing on machine learning and signal processing at the <a href="https://www.dtu.dk/english">Technical University
of Denmark</a> (DTU). Here my research focused on feature extraction in conjunction
with Bayesian non-parametrics. Supervised by <a href="http://www.mortenmorup.dk/">Morten M&oslash;rup</a>, I wrote my
master thesis on non-negative matrix factorization and the Indian Buffet
Process. In 2016 I received my BSc. in Earth and Space Physics and Engineering
at DTU, where i researched acoustic levitation of particles, supervised by
<a href="https://www.staff.dtu.dk/bruus">Henrik Bruus</a>.
