<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org38cd143">
<p>
\(N\) ants are dropped on a log with length \(L\). Each ant travels either left or
right with constant speed \(c\). When two ants collide, they bounce off each
other, reversing their direction. When an ant reaches the end of the log, it
falls off. The initial position of each is follows a i.i.d. and follows a
uniform distribution \(\mU(0, L)\).

Questions:

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Whats is the longest possible time it could take for all ants to fall off the log?</li>
<li>What is the average time it takes for all ants to fall off?</li>

First we realize that the bouncing dynamics is equivalent to pretending the ants
do not bounce at all and simply walk straight through each other. It follows
that the ant that has to walk the <b>longest</b> distance determines when <b>all</b> ants
has fallen off the log.
</p>

<p>
The longest possible distance is \(L\) and so the maximum time \(t_{\mr{max}}\) over
all possible ways the ants can placed on the log is,
</p>

<p>
\[t_{\mr{max}}=\frac{L}{c}\].

To answer this question we simply refer consider the same dynamics and work out
\(\mean{t_{\mr{max}}}\) using order statistics. Recall the $k$th order statistics
is denoted \(X_{(k)}\), where \(X_{(k)}\) is the \(k\)&rsquo;th largest random value out of
a sequence of \(N>k\) random variables such that for all \(k'\lt N\) \(X_{(k'\lt
k)}\lt X_{(k)}\lt X_{(k'\gt k)}\). The distribution of \(X_{(k)}\) is given by,
</p>

<p>
\[
p_{k}(X_{(k)})=\frac{N!}{(k-1)!(N-k)!}P(X\leq
X_{(k)})^{k-1}P(X>X_{(k)})^{N-k}p(X_{(k)}).
\]
</p>

<p>
Since an ant&rsquo;s position is uniformly distributed, we have that \(P(X\leq
X_{(k)})=\frac{X_{(k)}}{L}\) and \(P(X>X_{(k)})=1-\frac{X_{(k)}}{L}\). To answer
Q2, we notice that just like for Q1, we have that the ant with the longest
distance determines the time for all ants to fall off. That is, considering that
we can view the ants as being able to walk through each other, we look for the
biggest distance any ant has to walk, i.e., the $N$th order statistics. This
leads to,
</p>

\begin{align*}
\meanp{p_{N}(X_{(N)})}{X_{(N)}}&=\int_{X_{(N)}=0}^{X_{(N)}=L} X_{(N)} \frac{N!}{(N-N)!(N-1)!}\paren{X_{(N)}\frac{1-X_{(N)}}{L}}^{N-N}\paren{\frac{X_{(N)}}{L}}^{N-1}\frac{1}{L} \dm{X_{(N)}} \\
&= \frac{N}{L^{N}}\int_{X_{(N)}=0}^{X_{(N)}=L}X_{(N)}^{N}\dm{X_{(N)}}= \frac{N}{N+1}\frac{L^{N+1}}{L^{N}} = \frac{N}{N+1}L.
\end{align*}

<p>
Such that,
</p>

<p>
\[
\mean{t_{\mr{ants~off}}}= \frac{\meanp{p_{N}(X_{(N)})}{X_{(N)}}}{c} = \frac{N}{N+1}\frac{L}{c}.
\]
</p>


<p>
Note that this derivation takes into account that the ants could face either
way. Even though it is never explicitly accounted for, we achieve it by
considering the distribution of <b>unsigned</b> (i.e. which direction they have to
do) distances.
