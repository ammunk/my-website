This note will discuss optimal decision strategies in the context of a
classification problem, and largely builds on section 1.5 in [<a href="#bishop2006a">Bishop, 2006</a>].

Our goal is to assign \(\vx\in\gX\) (for instance \(\real^d\)) to one of the \(K\)
classes such that we minimize the probability of making a mistake (or maximize
the probability of being correct).
</p>

<p>
Here we consider the classification problem, where we know a class posterior
\(p(y=k|\vx)\), for \(k=1,\dots,K\) with \(K\) being the total number of classes.
</p>

<p>
Intuitively, given a certain \(\vx'\) we should predict \(k^*=\argmax_k
p(y=k|\vx)\) as the probability of being correct is equal to \(p(y=k^*|\vx)\)
which therefore is maximized. However, we will show a different way to derive
this which (may) give a more fundamental understanding. We can do this by
considering partitioning the space \(\gX\) into \(K\) regions one for each class
such that \(\cup_{k=1}^K\gR_k = \gX\) and \(\cap_{k=1}^K \gR_k=\emptyset\), and then
assign any \(\vx\in\gR_k\) to the class k. We now consider the event that we
\(\vx\) belongs to class \(y=k\) and we accurately assign \(\vx\) to the region
\(\gR_k\), and denote that event \(A_k={\vx\in\gR_k, y=k}\). We see that the
probability that we have correctly placed these regions must be equal the
probability that any of the \(k\) event occur w.r.t. the joint distribution on
\((\vx,y=k)\). Using basic probability theory the probability that either of the
\(A_k\) occur is equal to the probability of the union of the \(A_k\) events,
</p>

<p>
$$
</p>
\begin{align*}
P(\mr{correct})&=P(\cup_{k=1}^K A_k)\\
  &=\sum_{k=1}^K P(A_k)\\
  &=\sum_{k=1}^K p(\vx\in\gR_k,y=k) \\
  &=\sum_{k=1}^K\int_{\gR_k}p(\vx,y=k)\dm{\vx}\\
  &=\sum_{k=1}^K\int_{\gR_k}p(y=k|\vx)p(\vx)\dm{\vx}.
\end{align*}
<p>
$$
</p>

<p>
Since we can choose \(\gR_k\) freely, we should pick each region such that we
maximize the integrant for each \(\vx\), i.e. pick \(\gR_k\) that maximizes
\(p(y=k|\vx)p(\vx)\forall \vx\in\gX\). Because \(p(\vx)\) is invariant to the
choice of \(k\) we should pick \(\gR_k=\tub{\vx:p(y=k|\vx)>p(y=i), \forall
i\neq k}\).
</p>

<p>
We can also equivalently derive this by minimizing the probability of making
mistakes. Like before we write the probability of making a mistake, by defining
\(B_k=\tub{\vx\in\gR_k, y\neq k}=\cup_{i\neq k}\tub{\vx\in\gR_k, y=i}\) (we make
a mistake if we assign \(\vx\) to class \(k\) but it is not), and so we write,
</p>

<p>
\[
\balnn
P(\mr{mistake})&=P(\cup_{k=1}^K B_k)\\
  &=\sum_{k=1}^K P(B_k)\\
  &=\sum_{k=1}^K \sum_{i\neq k} p(\vx\in\gR_k,y=i) \\
  &=\sum_{k=1}^K\sum_{i\neq k}\int_{\gR_k}p(\vx,y=i)\dm{\vx}\\
  &=\sum_{k=1}^K\sum_{i\neq k}\int_{\gR_k}p(y=i|\vx)p(\vx)\dm{\vx}\\
  &=1 - P(\overline{\cup_{k=1}^K B_k})\\
  &=1 - P(\cup_{k=1}^K A_k),
\ealnn
\]

<p>
where the complement \(\cup_{k=1}^K A_k=\overline{\cup_{k=1}^K B_k}\) follows from
the properties of set theory, \(\overline{\cup_{k=1}^K A_k}=\cap_{k=1}^K\overline{A_k}\) -
i.e. the complement of all the cases where we are correct must be all the cases
where we are wrong, which is precisely the $B_k$s (and vice versa).

This note has been focusing on situations where we know (or assume to know via a
trained classifier) the class posterior \(p(y|\vx)\). Being Bayesian, I certainly
prefer taking this probabilistic approach as it allows me to reason about the
system probabilistically. However, there is no profound reason why one should
choose to be probabilistic, although there are certain benefits over for
instance learning a <i><b>decision function</b></i>, which has dropped any notion of
probability. Just to name a few:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Learning a posterior \(p(y|\vx)\) allows one to account for loss functions
post-hoc - see <a href="../LOSSFuncTIONS">this note</a> on how to do that.</li>
<li><p>
We can change the prior at any point as follows
$$
</p>
\begin{align*}
p(y|\vx) &\propto p(\vx|y)p(y) \\
&\Downarrow\\
\hat{p}(y|\vx) &\propto \frac{p(\vx|y)}{p(y)}\hat{p}(y)
\end{align*}
<p>
$$
where \(p(y)\) would be the prior used during training, and \(\hat{p}(y)\) is the
new prior. <b>Note</b> how this formulation used proportionality, i.e. once the
prior is changed one would need to renormalize. Of course this is only
sensible if we can assume the conditional \(p(y|\vx)\) can be transferred to
the system with a different prior.
