<p>
This note will touch upon <i><b>loss functions</b></i> and their expected minimization. A
much more rigorous discussion on this topic can be found in e.g. section 1.5 in
[<a href="#bishop2006a">Bishop, 2006</a>].
</p>

<p>
While we here consider the minimization of loss functions there is another
formulation of the same problem, namely the maximization of the <i><b>utility
function</b></i>. However, the two formulations coincide, as the negative loss
functions would be equal to a utility function we then maximize.
</p>

<p>
A loss function \(\gL(\cdot)\) takes as argument whatever defines our loss.
For instance, for a classification problem (or regression problem with scalar
predictions) \(\gL(\cdot)=\gL(\vx,y)\). Typically, we have control of the loss
via some parameter (otherwise we have no problem to begin with as there is
nothing we can do to minimize our loss&#x2026;). We denote these &ldquo;parameters&rdquo;
\(\theta\), and emphasize they they can represent anything from the set of
decision regions (like in some classification problems) to parameters of a
linear function (like in some specific regression problems). Often, however,
these will be parameters in the sense that we can find them using some
optimization algorithm. We find the optimal parameters \(\theta^*\) by minimizing
the expected loss,
</p>

<p>
$$
</p>
\begin{equation}\label{eq:opt}
\theta^* = \argmin_{\theta}\E_{p(\cdot)}\br{\gL(\cdot;\theta)}
\end{equation}
<p>
$$
</p>

<p>
Returning to the classification example, the loss function would allow for
considering making some wrong predictions worse than others. To use a classical
example: consider a scenario in the medical industry, where we try to classify
certain medical tests as either indicating a condition that needs treatment or
indicating a healthy subject. We probably would penalize predicting the
indication of being healthy if the subject actually has a medical condition much
more heavily than the opposite scenario. That is to say we want to be quite
certain about deeming someone being healthy, because being wrong could be fatal.

As an example we can re-derive our previous result on how to classify \(\vx\)
given that we know \(p(\vy|\vx)\).
</p>

<p>
Define \(i\in\tub{i,\dots,K}\) and \(k\in\tub{1,\dots,K}\) where \(K\) is the number
of classes and consider the following loss function,
</p>

<p>
\[
\gL(\vy=k,\vx;\theta)=l_{ik}
\]
</p>

<p>
where the parameter &ldquo;\(\theta\)&rdquo; is the \(i\) i.e. how we classify \(\vx\). This loss
functions simply says that there is some cost associated with guessing class \(i\)
but the real class was \(k\).
</p>

<p>
The minimization \eqref{eq:opt} now becomes
</p>

<p>
\[
\min\E_{p(\cdot)}\br{\gL(\cdot;\theta)} =\min \int\sum_{k=1}^K l_{ik} p(y|\vx)p(\vx)\dm{\vx}.
\]
</p>

<p>
We may recover the result found in <a href="../DECISION-THEORY">this note</a>, where we seek to determine
decision regions in classification problems, by setting,
</p>

<p>
\[
l_{ik}=\begin{cases}
0 & \mr{if}~i=k\\
a & \mr{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\] 
</p>

<p>
Here we placed no loss contribution for correct classification whereas there is
some loss \(a\) for being wrong (same loss for all classes). Clearly, we minimize
the loss by choosing \(i\) such that we minimize \(\sum_{k=1}^K l_{ik}p(y=k|\vx)\)
for all \(\vx\) (as \(p(\vx)\) is independent of \(k\)). Because we penalize being
wrong equally across all classes, we should choose to predict the class
\(i=\argmax_{i}p(y=i|\vx)\), i.e. predict the class \(i\) with highest probability.
</p>

<p>
It should now be clear that by redefining \(l_{ik}\) we can introduce different
penalizing strategies for making erroneous decisions, like the medical example
discussed earlier. This in turn would result in having to make potentially
different decisions.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org45a7d4d">
<p>
We may choose \(\gL\) freely in such a way that we incorporate desired properties
associated with the optimization problem \eqref{eq:opt}. This is in contrast to,
for instance, minimizing the divergence between two distribution which <i><b>is</b></i>
principled and hold a very specific meaning. In general I wouldn&rsquo;t consider the
loss function as principled since any given arbitrary loss function need not be
justified by any set of associated assumptions. For instance there is no
particular reason why the squared error is better than the absolute error for a
regression problem.
</p>

<p>
However, in some cases a specific choice of loss function \(\gL\) will coincide
with a principled objective (if it is associated with a set of assumptions),
such as certain maximum likelihood approaches - see table below for a small set
of examples,
